# Maji-Ndogo-Water-Crisis-Project
Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis to address the water crisis in Maji Ndogo by analyzing various data points and uncovering patterns and trends through clustering techniques.

# Objective
As a participant in this project, the goal is to utilize data science techniques to identify and understand the factors contributing to Maji Ndogo's water crisis. This involves cleaning and preparing the data, analyzing locations and water sources, and ultimately providing insights that can inform potential solutions to the crisis.

  ### Introduction
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository contains the following sections:
  1. Overview of the project goals and objectives.
  2. Setting the stage for the data exploration journey.

  ### Data Cleaning

  1. Steps taken to clean and update the dataset.
  2. Updating employee data and ensuring data integrity.
  Example SQL queries used for cleaning operations, such as generating email addresses and correcting phone numbers.

  ### Data Analysis

  Techniques used to analyze the locations and water sources in Maji Ndogo.
  Visualization of the scope of the problem using various data visualization tools.
  
  ### Clustering Analysis

  Application of clustering algorithms to group data points and identify   patterns.
  Interpretation of the clustering results to uncover broader narratives and hidden correlations.
  
  ### Reporting Insights
